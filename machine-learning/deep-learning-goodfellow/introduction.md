**Representation learning** is to use machine learning to discover not only the mapping from representation to output but also the representation itself.

A **multilayer perceptron** (fully connected feed-forward network) is just a mathematical function mapping some set of input values to output values.

### Historical Trends in Deep Learning

1. Cyberneticsin (1940s–1960s)
2. Connectionismin (1980s–1990s)
3. Deep learning (beginning in 2006)
