# Algorithm

### Breadth-First Search or BFS

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# This class represents a directed graph
# using adjacency list representation
class Graph:

	# Constructor
	def __init__(self):

		# default dictionary to store graph
		self.graph = defaultdict(list)

	# function to add an edge to graph
	def addEdge(self,u,v):
		self.graph[u].append(v)

	# Function to print a BFS of graph
	def BFS(self, s):

		# Mark all the vertices as not visited
		visited = [False] * (max(self.graph) + 1)

		# Create a queue for BFS
		queue = []

		# Mark the source node as
		# visited and enqueue it
		queue.append(s)
		visited[s] = True

		while queue:

			# Dequeue a vertex from
			# queue and print it
			s = queue.pop(0)
			print (s, end = " ")

			# Get all adjacent vertices of the
			# dequeued vertex s. If a adjacent
			# has not been visited, then mark it
			# visited and enqueue it
			for i in self.graph[s]:
				if visited[i] == False:
					queue.append(i)
					visited[i] = True

g = Graph()
g.addEdge(0, 1)
g.addEdge(0, 2)
g.addEdge(1, 2)
g.addEdge(2, 0)
g.addEdge(2, 3)
g.addEdge(3, 3)

'''
0 - 1
| /
2 - 3(self-loop)
'''

print ("Following is Breadth First Traversal"
				" (starting from vertex 2)")
g.BFS(2)

# Output will be "2 0 3 1" 
```

**Defaultdict** is a container like [dictionaries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary/) present in the module **collections**. Defaultdict is a sub-class of the dictionary class that returns a dictionary-like object. \
The functionality of both dictionaries and defaultdict are almost same except for the fact that **defaultdict never raises a KeyError. It provides a default value for the key that does not exists.**

```python
from collections import defaultdict
```

### Depth First Search or DFS

```python
# Python3 program to print DFS traversal
# from a given graph
from collections import defaultdict

# This class represents a directed graph using
# adjacency list representation
class Graph:

	# Constructor
	def __init__(self):

		# default dictionary to store graph
		self.graph = defaultdict(list)

	# function to add an edge to graph
	def addEdge(self, u, v):
		self.graph[u].append(v)

	# A function used by DFS
	def DFSUtil(self, v, visited):

		# Mark the current node as visited
		# and print it
		visited.add(v)
		print(v, end=' ')

		# Recur for all the vertices
		# adjacent to this vertex
		for neighbour in self.graph[v]:
			if neighbour not in visited:
				self.DFSUtil(neighbour, visited)

	# The function to do DFS traversal. It uses
	# recursive DFSUtil()
	def DFS(self, v):

		# Create a set to store visited vertices
		visited = set()

		# Call the recursive helper function
		# to print DFS traversal
		self.DFSUtil(v, visited)

# Driver code

# Create a graph given
# in the above diagram
g = Graph()
g.addEdge(0, 1)
g.addEdge(0, 2)
g.addEdge(1, 2)
g.addEdge(2, 0)
g.addEdge(2, 3)
g.addEdge(3, 3)

'''
0 - 1
| /
2 - 3(self-loop)
'''

print("Following is DFS from (starting from vertex 2)")
g.DFS(2)

# Output will be "2 0 1 3"
```
